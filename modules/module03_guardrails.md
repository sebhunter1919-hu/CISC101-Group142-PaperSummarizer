Module 3: Guardrails

Skip missing/empty sections and log them in “Checks & Warnings.”

Handle <50-word sections with a short note instead of a full summary.

Apply hallucination-mitigation rules:

Only include content explicitly in the paper.

Never fabricate sections, figures, or citations.

Admit uncertainty if information is absent.

Implement long-paper chunking (process [chunk1], [chunk2]) for very long sections.
